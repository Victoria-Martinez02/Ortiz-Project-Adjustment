Computer Organization Project - Fall 2022  
Using assembly students were required to encrypt/decrypt a file.  
Students were provided C code for the what should happen during each step of the encryption.  
It was up to the students to determine the approach to take when writing it in assembly and what  
steps were need in order to decrypt the file.  
  
To view the assemply code refer to, EncryptData_Initial.cpp and DecryptData_Initial.cpp
